This is a class average program I made after learning alot about javascript from w3schools! Most of the time to make this project went into learning how. 
I learned alot making this project, I did not copy anyone in the creation of this, I only used w3schools tuturials! Hopefully this porgram demonstrates my basic ability to use javascript! 

This program basicly modifys all the variables on a click of a button. I also used alot of if/else statements to make this program tell you what letter grade you have!
